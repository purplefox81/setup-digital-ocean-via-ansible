install ansible on the control machine. in my case I used brew to install ansible on Mac.
verify the installation by `ansible --version`
add the ssh pub key of the control machine to the remote machines which to be remotely auto configured
perform a "ssh root@remoteIp" to make sure we can successfully log in to the remote machine
create a inventory file named "hosts", which list all remote servers are meant to be configured
